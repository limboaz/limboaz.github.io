		<h1>About Me</h1>
</p>
	<div>
		<p>
			I started programming when I transferred to Stony Brook University in January 2017. It has not been a long time till now, but things work like a magic click that I have found my passion, and decided to go for a research career in system-related fields. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I am currently working on <a href="http://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/project-fsbench.html">fsbench</a> and <a href="http://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/project-hpcperf.html">hpcperf</a> at Filesystems and Storage Lab (FSL) at Stony Brook University, supervised by Prof. Erez Zadok, sponsored by NSF. 
		</p>
		<p>Prior to joining FSL, I have worked on mobile computing with Prof. Fan Ye at CEWIT. I also spent a summer at Tencent as an SDE intern.</p>
