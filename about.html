			It took me a while to figure out my life direction. In 2015, I started college at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in China, majoring in
		Digital Media Technology, which is basically a specialization in Computer Graphics. It turned out I didn't like what was taught/how it was taught and had no chance to switch major.
			I never imagined myself having to code, and never thought I was capable of doing it. I was upset for a very long time and saw no hope in college, until I learned that I could transfer to U.S. colleges.
			It became the turning point of my life.

			I applied to Stony Brook University as Area-of-interest in Computer Science, with the intention of switching to Psychology after the first semester. However, the CS classes I took changed my perspective on my relationship with Computer Science.
			I started to think maybe I could do it, and it is actually fun to code. Then I began scavenging knowledge, diving deep through taking many classes (bad idea, GPA disaster) and doing research.
			It was a very satisfying and fulfilling process, and I built up my determination in pursuing a Computer Science career. I was uncertain about whether I wanted to enter the industry or academia, so I decided to try both ways. I interned at companies, served as
			Teaching Assistant for three semesters and took classes that built up my interest in systems. It was all fun and helpful to make a responsible life choice, but I found myself having an insatiable craving for intellectual challenges and knowledge and eventually decided to focus on research.

			My goal is to learn, create and have fun, while potentially making some impact to expand the limit of the known, even just for a little bit. I also hope to be able to inspire more people who are in self-doubt of their capability to study Computer Science, as a female engineer/researcher.
