			It took me a while to figure out my life direction. In 2015, I started college at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in China, majoring in
		Digital Media Technology, which is basically a specialization in Computer Graphics. It turned out I didn't like what was taught/how it was taught and had no chance to switch major.
			I never imagined myself having to code, and never thought I was capable of doing it. I was upset for a very long time and saw no hope in college, until I learned that I could transfer to U.S. colleges then change my major to whatever I want there.

			I applied to Stony Brook University as Area-of-interest in Computer Science, with sole intention of switching to Psychology afterwards. However, the CS classes I took changed my perspective on my relationship with Computer Science.
			I started to believe maybe I could do it, and it is actually fun to code. Then I began scavenging knowledge, diving deep through taking many classes (bad idea, GPA disaster) and doing research.
			It was a very satisfying and fulfilling process, and I built up my determination in pursuing a Computer Science career. I was uncertain about whether I wanted to enter the industry or academia. In order to make responsible life choices, I decided to try both ways. I interned at companies, served as
			Teaching Assistant for three semesters and took classes that lead to my interest in systems. I found myself having an insatiable craving for intellectual challenges and knowledge and eventually decided to focus on research.

			My goal is to learn, create and have fun, potentially make some impact to expand the boundary of knowledge, even just for a little bit. I also hope to be able to inspire more people, especially women, who are in self-doubt of their capability to study Computer Science, as I have stumbled and lost my way but eventually figured out what I want.
			It is never too late, or too hard to start learning something, and it is okay to stumble, get lost or even fail. It may sound like cliche, but all it takes to study Computer Science, or anything, is passion, curiosity and hard work.
