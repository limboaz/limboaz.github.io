		<h1>About Me</h1>
</p>
	<div>
		<p>
			I typed my first "Hello World" at the beginning of 2017 after transferring to Stony Brook from China. Though it has not been a long time for me to scramble around programming, I have gained various experience and skills in this field, which motivates me to pursue a further understanding about computer science. Thus, I picked up applied math major, since computer science is essentially just math and it will help me to understand how things work fundamentally.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have been working on projects from low level like assembly to highly integrated stuff like Narrowband IoT and etc. I'm open to work with new technologies and learn whatever is needed for the work to be done, as long as it is interesting (or not, I can still force myself but not very happily). My experience in programming can be found on my resume in details.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before diving into programming, I was an award-winning debater doing British Parliamentary Debate in both English and Chinese. I am also a certified adjudicator and trainer of debate tournaments. I have adjudacated in national debate opens and trained over 30 debaters. Further details are also included in my resume. This experience developed my communication and problem solving skills, and somehow influenced me to start programming.
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides programming and debating, I draw sometimes, go skateboarding sometimes, play video games and do makeup for other people :)
