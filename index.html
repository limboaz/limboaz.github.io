					I started programming in January 2017. It has not been a long time, but things worked out like a magic click that I have found my passion, and decided to go for a research career in system-related fields. I am generally interested in building complex software/hardware.

				<p>
					I am currently working on <a href="http://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/project-fsbench.html">fsbench</a> and <a href="http://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/project-hpcperf.html">hpcperf</a> at Filesystems and Storage Lab (FSL) at Stony Brook University, supervised by Prof. Erez Zadok, sponsored by NSF.
				</p>
				<p>Prior to joining FSL, I have worked on mobile computing with Prof. Fan Ye at CEWIT. I also spent a summer at Tencent as an SDE intern.
